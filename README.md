# Landon Dao - Software Engineer
Hey there! I started this project to allow myself to learn react. The first place I thought to start was on my profile. I previously made a profile using vanilla javascript, html and css. Now on the opposite spectrum, I wanted to make this website using a JS framework. The reason why I chose react is because I intend to build a web app that doubles as a mobile app.
