        "description": "Moving to GE is the best thing I've ever done. The tech stack is pretty large which exposed me to many languages and applications. I got to see the different coding styles and design patterns. Everyone at this company was smart, and I did not hesitate to learn from them. My role started out as a developer, but quickly turned into more of a site reliability engineer. I learned the ins and outs of linux and windows machines as well as many languages. Although GE was going through a tough transitional period, I found it to be the most challenging and exciting part about the company."

        "description": "After my first semester of java programming, my professor saw that I had enough talent to recommend me to be a programming tutor. I saw it as an opportunity to get ahead. Although I was not the strongest tutor in the college, I unofficially sat in on advanced programming classes to better my skills and better aid more advanced students."
