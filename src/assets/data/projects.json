        "challenges": "We had two methods of deploying the package: Opsware and Rundeck. Opsware accepted bash, python and powershell scripts while Rundeck accepted Ansible playbooks. Rundeck had cross-platform playbooks, and Opsware for windows was pretty safe with powershell 3. The hardest part was linux for Opsware. There were so many flavors of linux and versions of kernals. After I got major installation steps completed, I spent plenty of time tweaking the package to work perfectly on different linux flavors.",

        "challenges": "We had no guaranteed connection to the server besides RabbitMQ, our message bus. We came up with a solution to serialize data, send it through RabbitMQ, rebuild the data on the client and install the data. A major contributor of Sensu said that reloading the agent without root was impossible, but we managed to reload certain pieces of the client to mimic a reload initiated by root. The next challenging part was fixing bugs. Our standalone development environment only got us so far. Many bugs showed when we moved to a distributed environment. Needless to say, we fixed the bugs. To add more complexity, we had to migrate chef to new environment in the middle of project. ",

        "challenges": "When I first saw the code, I noticed many functions were doing much more than the function name stated. Getters were setting fields and every variable was an instance variable regardless of scope. I refactored to code to be modular and plugable. Another issue was test cases. The repo previously had only a few test cases. I increased the number to 54 and covered every case, so any bad data would not break the handler.",

        "challenges": "Getting the servers to cooperate with LDAP took a while. I had all of my configurations correct. The problem was the base_dn I was given. It was all lowercase with a single character capitalized. I thought it was meant to be capitalized, so I struggled with the errors until I finally found someone who gave me the correct base_dn with all lowercase characters. The second problem was allowing clients to bootstrap without having to manually trust the server's certificate. After getting a signed certificate from a certificate authority, I put the certificate on the server and pointed nginx to use them. Our next problem occurred when we started spinning up new instances using our new chef server. All of the cookbooks were failing because they were outdated. To add complexity, GE github removed anonymous access which most of our cookbooks accessed github repos without authentication. We fixed all of the cookbooks and upgraded our self-managed redis cluster to an AWS managed elasticache redis cluster. Overall performance of the platform greatly increased.",

        "description": "In order to consolidate the tech stack, we incorporated snmp traps into sensu. The goal was to be able to scale out the trap servers behind an nginx load balancer. We created a cookbook to provision a sensu client with an snmp trap receiver plugin, updated an existing nginx cookbook to allow a udp upstream and configured AWS NACL/Security Groups for our vpc, subnet and ec2 instances to allow inbound traffic on port 162. I really enjoyed this project because it allowed me to learn so much about networking.",
        "challenges": "We stood up the servers quickly, but the network firewall rules controlled by the network team denied us. To overcome this, we submitted change requests to open our ports. The second and main issue is forwarding the source ip address to the snmp traps. The nginx load balancer was sending its own ip address with the request to the snmp server. We ended up configuring ip transparency on the nginx servers and disabling the source/destination check on the elastic network interface.",

        "challenges": "I inherited this api in a state of confusion. The team previously running the api inherited it from another team that was disbanded. This project was difficult to develop locally, which made deployments very scary. The first thing I did was set up a local environment and spin up the tornado api on my machine. I started by fixing many bugs and inefficiencies. After everything seemed well, I worked on adding more functionality that allowed the system to perform more intelligently.",
