    "text": "I have a passion for learning new technologies and developing my own skill set. Currently, I am attending Georgia Tech for my masters in computer science. I am attracted towards full stack development and devops because I like knowing exactly what to do when there is anything wrong with my system. I think it is important to understand what side effects application software might have on a server. Too often, I see servers become negatively impacted because of the applications that run on them. Within a large corporation, the server team is unable to resolve the issue, and the application team using that server sees nothing wrong with their application, so the problem goes on forever. I have a dream that one day all KPIs will be met and SLA will not be breached. Until then, I will continue to make platforms and systems suck a little less."
