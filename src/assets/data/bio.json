    "text": "I have a passion for learning new technologies and developing my own skill set. Currently, I am attending Georgia Tech for my masters in computer science. I am attracted towards full stack development and devops because I like knowing exactly what to do when there is anything wrong with my system. I think it is important to understand what side effects application software might have on a server. My style of development tends to focus on optimization and maintainability. I add tracing to my code to make metrics like five 9's easily visible from a back-end perspective. I use a combination of object-oriented and functional programming to make my code cleaner. Every day I try to push the limits of my knowledge and capabilities."
